# Penny-fyt

## Overview of Project:</br>
> _**Penny-fyt** is a **social donating platform** that allows users to </br>**passively donate to NPOs** by **liking and commenting** on **status updates.**_

Donating to charity is harder than liking a post about a cause on social media. Researching causes, putting payment info into different websites, and following up on how the donation was used are hurdles a donor must jump over while donating, while liking something only takes one click. Penny-Fyt removes the confusion in the donation process by combining social media and donating to create a platform where users donate by liking or commenting on a post created by a charity, in a community where donors can connect with charities and keep up-to-date with how their donations are making a difference.

# Technology Decisions</br>

**Firebase**: For our database needs we elected to use Firebase for several reasons. 
1. Firebase is cloud-based and is continuously synced with associated clients. We believe this project, if extended beyond the iSchool Capstone, will expand into IOS and Android platforms. Users will require real-time updates from the database and it avoided us from having to develop our own database or API. 
2. Firebase features a backend registeration and login service, which is vital for our project. 

**Google Charts**: For our analytics, we elected to use Google Charts. Google Charts is an interactive tool created by Google. We decided to use Charts mainly due to its similarity to python packages. Additionally, Google Charts is easy to use, and more imoprtantly it has cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility, which we believed was important for the growth of our project. Additionally, Google Charts has the ability to intake data from a variety of inputs, therefore it provided us with more flexibility. 

**Google Material Design**: For our interface, we decided to use Google Material Design. Material Design is a visual design framework developed by Google. We understood that user experience and user interface is vital to our project, therefore the proven UX/UI of the Material Design framework was the biggest reason we selected for our project. Additionally, we expect growth into other platforms for Penny-fyt (Mobile, IOS, Android) and the Material Design framework allows the same prototype to be used for web, mobile and App.
